# VVV DevDash - Custom Dashboard
Forked from [@TopDown](https://github.com/topdown/VVV-Dashboard)

This is a Varying Vagrant Vagrants Dashboard for the excellent [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)

Its purpose is to dynamically load host links to all sites created in the VVV www path.

It also suggests the wonderful add-on bash script [VVV Site Wizard](https://github.com/aliso/vvv-site-wizard) for creating new sites.

Instructions
-
Clone this repo to your VVV/www/default/ directory (`git clone https://github.com/topdown/VVV-Dashboard.git dashboard`)

Copy the dashboard-custom.php to VVV/www/default/dashboard-custom.php

---
### UPDATE Instructions 
#### TODO: Make this automatic via Grunt/Shell Script
From your dashboard directory ```git pull```

You no longer need to copy the style.css anywhere.

Delete the old VVV/www/default/dashboard-custom.php and copy the new version to VVV/www/default/dashboard-custom.php

Now move your dashboard directory so it is inside VVV/www/default/

---

With Vagrant Up you should be able browse to your vagrant root www usually [vvv](http://vvv) or [vvv.dev](http://vvv.dev) and see the new dashboard.

** NEW: There are bound keys for the search feature, the enter key and down arrow key search down the list and the up arrow searches up.**
